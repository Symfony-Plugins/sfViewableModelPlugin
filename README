The `sfViewableModelPlugin` links symfony's view cache to your model and
automatically removes cached templates when model objects used to build them
are modified.

Installation
------------

To install, simply update your application's `config/factories.yml` to include
the plugin's view cache manager:

    [yml]
    # /apps/APP/config/factories.yml
    all:
      view_cache_manager:
        class: sfViewableModelViewCacheManager

Then clear your cache using `symfony cc` and watch how much smarter your
cache is!
